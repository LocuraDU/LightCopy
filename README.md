# LightCopy

Dual Universe LUA Util.

In-game `Programming Board XS` will copy the settings of the first light of any size linked to it, to all other lights directly linked to the PB.  

Install them in Build Mode, Link-tool to connect them to the PB, then Activate the PB.  All is done automatically.
